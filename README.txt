Hello Guys , 

Here , I am gonna show you how we get pro tags within an hour ..
So lets start....

Basic requirements are:-
    
    </> create at least (2-3) repo in your github profile,so that they can 
        judge you .
    </> least but  not last is that..
        you must have a mail id provided by the institute/college/school.
    </> And the last most important thing is you have to tell them how you
        would use the pro tag..
        simply, paste the below lines in
        (how do you plan to use GitHub?):-
        
        Github is a great platform for developers, on which we, developers
        can showcase our work to the world. As I am an undergraduate student
        and exploring new things each day and then I noticed that Github 
        provides a Student Developer Pack which is really beneficial for 
        student developers. As a student, I can’t afford money for buying
        domains for hosting my own websites, courses, for creating private
        repositories, collaborating with developers, etc. And this pack 
        provides me all these things. That’s why I am eagerly waiting to get
        Github Student Developer Pack for myself. Thanks!

Steps to follow :-

    </> go to chrome 
    </> type github student developer pack
    </> click on benefits (available at top right side)
    </> scroll down and fill the form
        
Thanks..
